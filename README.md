# TytechCalc
This function helps Tytech curate its device catalogue by calculating the final price of a device in KES. It takes into account the device price, weight, insurance, shipping cost, delivery charge, and commission.     The final price is returned after converting the total cost from USD to KES using the current exchange rate.
